        <h1>About The ARGH Tool</h1>
        
        <p>
            "The ARGH Tool" is a free, simple web app designed to help you take a moment and reset when you're feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, or just... "ARGH!" 
        </p>
        <p>
            This app was built as a simple, $0-cost toolbox to provide a few useful techniques for managing stress.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Inside?</h2>

        <h3>Just Breathe</h3>
        <p>
            This is a simple "box breathing" visual guide. This technique is used to help calm your nervous system. The pattern is simple: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, and hold for 4 seconds. Following the animation can help regulate your breathing and lower immediate feelings of anxiety.
        </p>

        <h3>Grounding Tool</h3>
        <p>
            This tool uses the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. The goal is to bring your mind back to the present moment by using your five senses. By forcing your brain to focus on what you can see, feel, hear, smell, and taste right now, it can help stop a cycle of anxious thoughts about the past or future.
        </p>

        <h3>Write It Out</h3>
        <p>
            This is a 100% private digital journal. Anything you type here is saved *only* to your own browser. It is never sent to a server, and no one else can see it. It's a safe place to vent your frustrations, write down what's bothering you, and get those thoughts out of your head.
